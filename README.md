## Who am I

I am a 2025 undergraduate student at USTC, currently studying **AI Infrastructure**, with a particular interest in **LLM inference**.  

I also maintain my own **CSDN blog**, and you are very welcome to check it out: [My CSDN Blog](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_71640350?spm=1011.2480.3001.5343)
